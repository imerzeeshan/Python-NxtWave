# Write a program that reads a number N and checks if the number N is a Negative Number or a Positive Number.

# Print Positive If N is greater than 0.
# Print Negative if N is less than 0.

# Input
# The input will be a single line containing a float representing 

# Output
# The output should be a single line containing a string. Positive
# should be printed if N is greater than 0. Negative should be
# printed if N is less than 0.

# Constraints
# The given number N is not equal to 0.




n = float(input())

if n > 0:
    print("Positive")
else:
    print("Negative")
